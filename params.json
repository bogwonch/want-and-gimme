{"name":"Want And Gimme","tagline":"Make scripts to Gimme what I Want","body":"# Want and Gimme\r\n\r\n* `want document.tex`: go figure out how to build me my document.\r\n* `gimme pdf`: work out if there is anything you can convert into a pdf and do so.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm working on a project I can't remember what all the build commands are so I use a Makefile.\r\nWherever possible I use implicit rules to just convert whatever I've called my code into the obviously named other format.\r\n\r\nSome of these come baked into Make through a config file hidden somewhere not documented in my manpages.  Screw this: just *gimme what I want*.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nRules go in `~/.makerules`.  Normal makefile syntax we all know and hate.  `want` will pick up this file and use it to try and build the files you want. \r\n\r\nThe `gimme` script is for when you're even more lazy and rude or you have a bunch of files that all need converting (like when you're writing `.dot` files then converting them to `.eps` to stick in a LaTeX document).   Just tell it to `gimme filetype` and it will try and convert any file it knows how to into that filetype.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nSome want rules are customizable!  You wanna convert a graphviz diagram but *just can't decide which layout engine to use?*  We've got you covered!  Use the `GV` variable to set the layout engine.  \r\n\r\nWanna see what other options are available?  Just run `want` without any arguments.\r\n\r\nDo you want to be *really* cool and add more options?  They're written in your `.makerules` file.\r\n\r\n`GV ?= dot # Sets the GraphViz layout engine`\r\n`OptionName ?= DefaultValue # Documentation`\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nMany.  Report and/or fix'em.  This was coded in an afternoon while trying to avoid my thesis proposal, but it's turned out useful enough for a real project.\r\n\r\n## Future features\r\n\r\n* Nicer output!\r\n* More rules (suggestions appreciated!)\r\n* `want a kitteh`\r\n* ~~`want a sandwich`~~\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
